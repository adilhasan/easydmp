  <h1>500 Server Error</h1>

  <p>There is currently a problem with EasyDMP, but at least enough
  is working to be able to show this error message! An
  automatically generated report should be on its way to the
  maintainers. You could try again in a little while in case it
  turns out to be a temporary problem. If the back button works it
  is probably only this page that is broken.</p>

  <p>If you wish to report it as a bug, please include which url
  you were visiting and the time and date you made your attempt so
  we can connect your info to the automatically generated report.
  Please send any bug report to:
  <a href="mailto:support@easydmp.sigma2.no">support@easydmp.sigma2.no</a>.</p>

  <p>(This page being very plain is very much intentional.)</p>
