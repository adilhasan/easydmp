Creating and editing templates
==============================

There is a very rough and ready method available to create linear plans in
EasyDMP.

Getting access to create linear templates
=========================================

A superuser must grant you the role ``Template Designer``. After
that, you get access to the *template admin* from the link ``Admin`` up
top.

How to create templates
=======================

Start by clicking 'Add' next to **Templates**. On the next page, add at least
a ``title`` and a ``description``. The ``abreviation`` is used only inside the
template admin in order to make some links shorter and easier to read at
a glance so you could skip that.

Give specific people access to the template
===========================================

Once the template is created you can click on **OBJECT PERMISSIONS** in the top
right corner. You'll need the email address the other person uses in
EasyDMP. Paste that into the "User identification" field and click ``Manage user``.

Allow a plan maker test the template
------------------------------------

Select ``Can use template`` in the left box and click on the little arrow to
the right, then click "Save", below.

Add another designer to the template
------------------------------------

Select edverything in the left box before clicking the little arrow to the
right, and then "Save", below.

Give everyone access to the template
====================================

The moment you set a date in the ``published``-field on the ``Template``
itself, the template is publically accessible. Do not do this before the
template is completely finished!
